## EECS 4612 Project 2 Test Framework ##

### Overview

This repository contains RTL, scripts, a testharness and test vectors
for functionally verifying your custom ASIC. 

### Setup (only have to do once)

To get started, run the following two commands to setup your path
and configure the testbench: 

source env.sh
make update
make setup b=0 f=0 a=0 k=1 M=1 N=1

The second command will create a random matrix/vector set W and X to place
in memory. It will also configure the PROC to send the ASIC commands based 
on your chosen bitwidth (b), activation function (f), subword (a), 
data arrangement (k), and matrix/vector dimensions (M and N).

Place all your verilog inside the vsrc directory. Use the Asic module defined 
in Asic.v as your top level module.

### Usage

After you're verilog has been written, run a simulation and view the 
waveform results by running the following three commands:

make simulator
make run
make view

### File Descriptions

Makefile        - Contains "recipes" for each step of the ASIC design flow

env.sh		- Sets up the user's PATH to reference VCS and Verdi 2022

vsrc		- Contains the verilog source files and test bench

simulation	- Contains all simulation related files

ExtMem.py	- Python script to randomly generate MxN matrix W and Nx1 matrix X.
		  It will produce several files including ExtMem.bin, R.bin, W.mat, 
		  X.mat and R.mat. 

ExtMem.bin	- Contains the data that the testbench will use to initialize external memory.
		  It holds the values of W and X which are contiguously arranged in row-major 
		  order starting at address 0. Each entry/block of the memory is a 64-bit word which 
		  holds a single 8/16 bit element of W or X. The testbench will read in the contents 
		  of ExtMem.bin into the external memory at the start of simulation.

R.bin		- Contains the product of W and X in binary format. It will be read in by the
		  test bench and used to verify the ASIC results.

W.mat		- Contains the values of the randomly generated MxN matrix W in human-readable,
		  row-major format. It's provided to allow the user to inspect W manually.

X.mat		- Contains the values of the randomly generated Nx1 matrix X in human-readable,
		  row-major format. It's provided to allow the user to inspect X manually.

R.mat		- Contains the values of the product of W and X in human-readable,
		  row-major format. It's provided to allow the user to inspect R manually.
