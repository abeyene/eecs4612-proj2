## EECS 4612 Project 2 Test Framework ##

### Overview

This repository contains RTL, scripts, a testharness and test vectors
for functionally verifying Ali's Decoder.

### Setup (only have to do once)

To get started, run the following three commands to setup your path
and files, and configure the testbench: 

source env.sh
make update
make setup

The third command will create a 1025x12818 16-bit scores and place them
in memory. 

Place all your verilog inside the vsrc directory. Use the Asic module defined 
in Asic.v as your top level module.

### Usage

After you're verilog has been written, run a simulation and view the 
waveform results by running the following three commands:

make simulator
make run
make view

### File Descriptions

Makefile    - Contains "recipes" for each step of the ASIC design flow

env.sh		  - Sets up the user's PATH to reference VCS and Verdi 2022

vsrc		    - Contains the verilog source files and test bench

simulation	- Contains all simulation related files

ExtMem.py	  - Python script to randomly generate the logpost values.
		          It will produce ExtMem.bin.

ExtMem.bin	- Contains the data that the testbench will use to initialize external memory.
		          It holds the values of random scores which are contiguously arranged starting at
		          address 0. Each entry/block of the memory is a 64-bit word which holds a single 
              16 bit score. The testbench will read in the contents of ExtMem.bin into the external 
              memory at the start of simulation.
