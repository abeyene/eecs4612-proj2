## EECS 4612 Project 2 Test Framework ##

### Overview

This repository contains RTL, scripts, a testharness and test vectors
for functionally verifying your custom ASIC. 

### Setup (only have to do once)

To get started, run the following two commands to setup your path 
and create random test data:

source env.sh
make setup M=m N=n      (m and n should be integers) 

Place all your verilog files inside the vsrc directory. Also, make 
sure to place your top level Asic module inside the Asic.v skeleton 
file already provided to you inside vsrc.

Note: Occasionally, updates will be posted to the remote GitHub repository.
To update your local files,  run the following two commands:

make update
make setup M=m N=n      (m and n should be integers) 

### Usage

After you're verilog has been written, run a simulation and view the 
waveform results by running the following three commands:

make simulator
make run
make view

### File Descriptions

Makefile        - Contains "recipes" for each step of the ASIC design flow

env.sh		- Sets up the user's PATH to reference VCS and Verdi 2022

vsrc		- Contains the verilog source files and test bench

simulation	- Contains all simulation related files

ExtMem.py	- Python script to randomly generate MxN matrix W and Nx1 matrix X.
		  It will produce several files including ExtMem.bin, R.bin, W.mat, 
		  X.mat and R.mat. 

ExtMem.bin	- Contains the data that the testbench will use to initialize external memory.
		  It holds the values of W and X which are contiguously arranged in row-major 
		  order starting at address 0. Each entry/block of the memory is a 64-bit word which 
		  holds a single 8/16 bit element of W or X. The testbench will read in the contents 
		  of ExtMem.bin into the external memory at the start of simulation.

R.bin		- Contains the product of W and X in binary format. It will be read in by the
		  test bench and used to verify the ASIC results.

W.mat		- Contains the values of the randomly generated MxN matrix W in human-readable,
		  row-major format. It's provided to allow the user to inspect W manually.

X.mat		- Contains the values of the randomly generated Nx1 matrix X in human-readable,
		  row-major format. It's provided to allow the user to inspect X manually.

R.mat		- Contains the values of the product of W and X in human-readable,
		  row-major format. It's provided to allow the user to inspect R manually.
